# ASTAnalyzer Thresholds Configuration Template
#
# This template provides default academic thresholds based on research from
# Lanza & Marinescu, Habchi et al., and SwiftLint. Customize these values
# based on your team's needs, codebase maturity, and development practices.
#
# Threshold Categories:
# - class_smells: Issues with individual classes/structs
# - method_smells: Issues with individual methods/functions
# - structural_smells: Issues with relationships between components
# - module_smells: Issues with file/module organization
#
# General Guidance:
# - Lower values = stricter analysis (more defects detected)
# - Higher values = more lenient analysis (fewer defects detected)
# - Consider your team's velocity, codebase size, and quality goals

class_smells:
  # God Class Detection
  # A class is considered a God Class if it exceeds these thresholds
  god_class_wmc: 47          # Weighted Methods per Class - complexity measure
  god_class_tcc: 0.33        # Tight Class Cohesion - how cohesive the class is (0.0-1.0)
  god_class_atfd: 5          # Access To Foreign Data - external data dependencies
  god_class_loc: 500         # Lines Of Code - raw size threshold

  # Multifaceted Abstraction (MFA)
  # Classes that do too many different things
  mfa_lcom: 0.725           # Lack of Cohesion in Methods - cohesion measure
  mfa_wmc: 34               # Alternative WMC threshold for MFA
  mfa_nof: 8                # Number Of Fields
  mfa_nom: 14               # Number Of Methods

  # Deficient Encapsulation
  # Classes that expose too much internal state
  deficient_encapsulation_woa: 0.3  # Weight of Access - public interface ratio

  # Lazy Class
  # Classes that don't contribute enough value
  lazy_class_nom: 5         # Number Of Methods threshold
  lazy_class_nof: 5         # Number Of Fields threshold
  lazy_class_dit: 2         # Depth In Tree (inheritance depth)

  # Massive View Controller (iOS-specific)
  # UIViewControllers that are too large
  massive_vc_nom: 20        # Number Of Methods
  massive_vc_noa: 15        # Number Of Attributes/Properties

method_smells:
  # Long Method Detection
  # Methods/functions that are too long or complex
  long_method_loc: 50       # Lines Of Code
  long_method_cc: 10        # Cyclomatic Complexity
  long_method_noi: 30       # Number Of Instructions (approximated)

structural_smells:
  # Message Chain
  # Long chains of method calls (obj.a().b().c().d())
  message_chain_length: 3   # Maximum chain length

  # Broken Hierarchy
  # Inheritance hierarchies that are too deep
  broken_hierarchy_dit: 3   # Maximum Depth In Tree

  # Cyclic Dependency
  # Circular dependencies between modules/classes
  cyclic_dependency_length: 2  # Maximum cycle length

  # Feature Envy
  # Methods that use more data from other classes than their own
  feature_envy_threshold: 3  # Access threshold

  # Dense Structure
  # Overly interconnected components
  dense_structure_degree: 0.5  # Connection density ratio (0.0-1.0)

  # Weakened Modularity
  # Loss of modular boundaries
  weakened_modularity_ratio: 1.0  # Modularity degradation ratio

module_smells:
  # Duplicate Code Blocks
  # Identical or very similar code segments
  duplicate_block_tokens: 150  # Minimum token count for duplication

  # Imperative Abstraction
  # Code that mixes high-level logic with low-level implementation
  imperative_abstraction_max_exec_count: 2      # Maximum executable statements
  imperative_abstraction_exec_ratio: 0.20       # Executable vs total code ratio

  # Insufficient Modularization
  # Files that are too large or complex
  insufficient_modularization_max_line_count: 40       # Maximum lines per file
  insufficient_modularization_max_nesting_depth: 3     # Maximum nesting levels
  insufficient_modularization_max_type_declarations: 1 # Maximum types per file

  # Missing Abstraction
  # Groups of related elements that should be abstracted
  missing_abstraction_max_elements: 2  # Maximum elements without abstraction

  # Unstructured Module
  # Files that lack proper structure
  unstructured_module_max_elements: 3  # Maximum unstructured elements
